# Welcome to UK Delivers

UK Delivers is a simple directory of independent businesses offering local delivery. Enabling people to stay at home and save lives, while keeping our high streets alive.

This project was originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you plan to create your own local directory using our template - please get in touch [robin@reigatedelivers.com](mailto:robin@reigatedelivers.com).

### Accounts required

There are four accounts required to get a UK Delivers app online.

* [Airtable](https://airtable.com) - For your database and listing form
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) - For deployment
* [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com) - For email sign-ups
* [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) - For hosting images on a Content Delivery Network (CDN)

A domain is also required. We recommend a '.com' URL for this.

### Brand

The design of each individual site is up to the owner and you will need to pick two hexadecimal values for your site; one for the large triangle and one for the smaller triangle. The base background blue is #0B132B.

_For reference, Reigate Delivers: Pink #E20C5E, Yellow #FFB600._

# Stage 01 - Local

To start, let's get a base version of the app live locally.

## Download template
Create a local folder for your app to live. You have two options with GitHub, either clone the repo (using the terminal) or download the Zip folder direct from the GitHub).

*To add: clone repo process...*

To get started you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). You have a choice of package managers: [Node package manager (npm)](https://nodejs.org) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

Using the terminal, navigate to your app folder to start a local version of the app.

### Via npm
To install the necessary Node modules:

```
cd app
npm install
```

To start the server, and access: 

```
npm start
http://localhost:3000/
```

**OR**

### Via Yarn
To install the necessary Node modules:

```
cd app
yarn install
```

To start the server, and access: 

```
yarn start
http://localhost:3000/
```

***NB. I had to update my version of Node.js - to update on Mac/Catalina:***

```
nvm install node
```

## Customisation
Time to run through the files in the repo and update to your specific location. If you'd like to build on what we have created - go for it.

# Stage 02 - Online

Once the app is available locally, let's get it online.

## Upload template to GitHub
Create a new repository on your GitHub account.

*To add: upload process...*

For the purposes of speed, we are currently working directly off `master`. Feel free to use a branch.

##### .gitignore
A `.gitignore` file should be included in your repo. If not, make sure you have one in place, otherwise `node_modules` will be uploaded to your repo.

To create a new file: 

```
touch .gitignore
```

And add `/node_modules` as your first entry. `Save`.

## Connect GitHub repo to Netlify
With a Netlify account created, let's get Netlify connected to your repository.

- From Netify dashboard, visit `Sites` and click `New site from Git`

- Select your Git Provider: `GitHub`

- Connect to your respective GitHub account and select repository

- Select your `Owner` and `Branch to deploy` and define your `Basic build settings`. For me these are:
 
	* Build command: `yarn build`
	* Publish directory: `build/`

- Click `Deploy site`

An initial deployment will start. Takes a minute or so to complete. Once deployed, a Netlify subdomain will be generated. Visit the subdomain to verify all ok with the deployment.

You can revisit your deployments at any time from `Deploys` in the Netlify admin.

### Custom domains

To activate your live domain, visit `Settings` - `Domain management` or click `Domain settings` from the `Overview` panel. 

Click `Add custom domain`.

### HTTPS

A custom domain is required before you enable a TLS certificate.

### Netlify CMS

To start adding live content to your app, we need to link the app to Netlify Content Management System.

- The `admin` is accessed from your live domain: e.g. `https://reigatedelivers.com/admin`

- The page will ask you to `Login with Netlify Identity`.

- The first time you click the button the following message appears:  
	*'Unable to access identity settings. When using git-gateway backend make sure to enable Identity service and Git Gateway.'*

- In order to enable `Identity service` and `Git Gateway` - revist Netlify.

- From the `Identity` tab in the admin, click `Enable Identity`.

- Once enabled revisit the `admin` page of your app, give it a refresh, click `Login with Netlify Identity` and `Signup`.

- Visit your email and click `Confirm you email address`.

#### Git Gateway

You will also need to also configure Git Gateway. You may receive the following message when you try to login to Netlify CMS:  
*'Your Git Gateway backend is not returning valid settings. Please make sure it is enabled.'*


- From the `Settings` tab in Netlify, click `Identity` and scroll down to `Services` and click `Enable Git Gateway`.

- `Edit settings` and `generate access token in GitHub`. `Save`.

- At the same time, click the `Identity` tab and all being well, your email address should be listed as a `User`.


***NB. Sometimes this part of the process can be a bit temperamental. I found closing all instances of the live app in the browser, redeploying the app from Netlify and launching a fresh version helps.***


If you visit the `/admin` of the app, it should automatically log you in if you've added your username and password.

More information about `Netlify Identity` can be found from their extensive documentation: [Netlify Docs](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/).

You can now start to add/edit/delete the necessary entries for your app.

### Cloudinary
With access to Netlify CMS, you'll see you can add `Media` to the CMS. This won't work until you have connected your Cloudinary account to the codebase.


## Connect Cloudinary to template
Cloudinary is currently the CDN of choice for Netlify CMS. We use it to store the images used for each listing header.

Update Cloudinary credentials in `public` - `admin` - `config.yml`

***NB. I found that Cloudinary did not play nicely with Safari browser (The `insert` option did not appear).***

## Connect MailChimp to template

Update link to MailChimp list in `src` - `App.js`

Once live, please feel free to email [robin@reigatedelivers.com](mailto:robin@reigatedelivers.com) to let us all know your directory is live.
